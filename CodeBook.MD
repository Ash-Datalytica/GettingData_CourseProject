###In Codebook.MD

- How and why variables were named in tidy5.txt.
Used [CamelCase notatiopn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) with lower case first - name always starts with a lower case letter, all other words begin with capital letter.  
While the CodeBook should give an explanation on the variables (Not the variables generated during the script), for instance, what does the variable represent, the measure, etc.

- The codebook still has the specific description of the tidy data file contents (and you mention that it exists and it's role in the ReadMe)
